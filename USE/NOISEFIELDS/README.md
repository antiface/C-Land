### NOISE FIELDS
* Noise Field Theory is at the basis of the Universal Synthesis Engine;
* We use a concept of "Noxels" or "Noxels" which more or less correspond to "pixels" and "voxels" and so forth in other domains;
* The difference is that at the heart of it all is Noise Field Theory and the Noxel/Nixel data model;
* What that means is that any structure can be created, it doesn't have to be a vector or a matrix or a bitmap or even an audio file, it's just a "modulated noise field";
* More to come on the subjects of "noise modelling" and "noise modulation";
* For the increasing importance of noise-based applications, see: Noise-based Logic @ [FLUCTUATION AND NOISE EXPLOITATION LABORATORY] (http://www.ece.tamu.edu/~noise/research_files/noise_based_logic.htm);
* In the code examples contained in the CODE folder above, we begin with "noise functions" which basically create what we might call "abstract data";
* Here we are using such "abstract data" to generate a digital image, but the same kind of data could also be used to create sounds;
* The idea is that the Noise Field is an abstract data model that in theory can be used to "sythesize" or "generate" ANY number of different data types, structures;
* In essence, ANYTHING could be synthesized/generated using Noise Fields, providing one has the right noise functions and modulation functions and so forth, various operations, methods of synthesis, processing, etc.;
* Also, in Noise Field Theory, a noise V(t), or N(t) if you will, is made up of the random variations of a quantity in time, i.e. this is the most "basic" definition;
* Everything else is built up from there, i.e. for one-dimensional noise fields, generate random values in one dimension, in two dimensions for two-dimensional noises, and so on and so forth;
* That is what a "noise function" does, it generates random values across dimensions, creating an abstract mathematical structure which can be represented in any medium, provided it has the capacity to represent such structures, i.e. Image(s), Sound(s), Physical Texture(s), etc.;
