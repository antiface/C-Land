### THE UNIVERSAL SYNTHESIS ENGINE (U.S.E.)
* Mathematical Objects are constructed, constructively;
* They can represent Sound Objects, Image Objects, any Object or Artifact, in principle and in theory;
* i.e. a Binary Image would just be an n x m matrix, all objects can be constructed as n-dimensional matrices, or n-polytopes;
* We give the example of a mathematical object called a "Historiotopia" or "Historiotope", which represents the changes over time of the configuration of an Abstract Workspace ("Workscape");
* The Universal Synthesis Engine (U.S.E.) is founded on the theory of Construction-Land, part of The Archives-Project;
