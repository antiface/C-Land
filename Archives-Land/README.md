### Archives-Land
* I call this thought experiment "Archives-Land";
* It is the idea that planet earth becomes a massive warehouse for storing things;
* We become like "ants" managing the massive complexes of storage warehouses that cover every square inch of the planet;
* Also: We propose a model for "Novel-Construction";
* That is, via a process of "Deconstructing The Novel", we come up with a data model for the "Contemporary Novel" and then describe its working parts and how they fit together to build the "Novel-as-System";
* Parts include, but are not limited to:
    * Setting: This can be thought of as the "world" in which the novel takes place;
        * There can be multiple such "worlds" in one novel;
        * In essence, every "scene" is its own world;
        * Every scene/world has its own supporting "world model";
    * Characters: Characters are an important part of most novels. They are the "actors", the "agents" that act in the "world model";
    * Plot: Plot is an important element of fiction, and therefore of novels;
    * Theme: Novels usually have "Themes" that they treat through the novel-form;
    * Style: The style of a novel is slightly more difficult to describe. In a sense, it is the result of all of the executive, editorial choices that an author makes when writing a novel;
        * Such strategic novel-writing decisions include: Point of view, Narrator, but also ["tactical choices of grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence and paragraph length and structure, tone, the use of imagery, chapter selection, titles, and on and on. In the process of writing a story, these choices meld to become the writer's voice, his or her own unique style."] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction_writing#Elements_of_fiction);
