### CITY-OF - CITY-TEMPLATE
* Cities have City Plans which are akin to City-Templates;
* The "City-Of" is a generalized City-Template for all Cities;
* The City-Of concept first appeared in the work The Venice of The City Part II;
* A City can be seen in terms of its topographical or geographic coordinate plane WITH its unique Acoustic Signature (ecoscape);
* Similarly, a Workspace has a Workscape, it is the Historiotopia of the Historiotheque;
* Cities are like massive Historiotheques, we call them a form of Historiotome;
