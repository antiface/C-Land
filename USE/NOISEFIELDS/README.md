### NOISE FIELDS
* Noise Field Theory is at the basis of the Universal Synthesis Engine;
* We use a concept of "Noxels" or "Noxels" which more or less correspond to "pixels" and "voxels" and so forth in other domains;
* The difference is that at the heart of it all is Noise Field Theory and the Noxel/Nixel data model;
* What that means is that any structure can be created, it doesn't have to be a vector or a matrix or a bitmap or even an audio file, it's just a "modulated noise field";
* More to come on the subjects of "noise modelling" and "noise modulation";
* For the increasing importance of noise-based applications, see: Noise-based Logic @ [FLUCTUATION AND NOISE EXPLOITATION LABORATORY] (http://www.ece.tamu.edu/~noise/research_files/noise_based_logic.htm);
